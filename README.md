  - These may include text, images, graphs, and other media
- Maintain certain elements of Wikipedia
  - General look and feel
  - Basic functionality
- Be able to import pages from Wikipedia
- Dark and light themes (currently only dark)
- Code base that is easy to follow and modify
- "It just works"
