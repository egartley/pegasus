# Pegasus

Lightweight, simpler alternative to Wikipedia

## Status

Focusing on functionality and modularity, rather than making everything look nice (that comes later). Due to the use of HTML5, mainly [`contenteditable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable), everything works best in Chromium.

## Demo

You can view an example page [here](https://go.egartley.net/pegasusexamplepage/?via=githubreadme1904)

## Goals

- Create, edit and view pages
  - These may include text, images, graphs, and other media
- Maintain certain elements of Wikipedia
  - General look and feel
  - Basic functionality
- Be able to import pages from Wikipedia
- Dark and light themes (currently only dark)
- Code base that is easy to follow and modify
- "It just works"
