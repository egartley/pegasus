Focusing on functionality and modularity, rather than making everything look nice (that comes later).

## Goals

- Create, edit and view pages
  - These can include text, images, graphs, and other media
- Maintain certain elements of Wikipedia
  - General look and feel
  - Basic functionality
- Code base that is easy to follow and modify
- "It just works"
